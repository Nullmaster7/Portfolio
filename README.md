# 3D Developer Portfolio
This portfolio showcases my expertise in modern web development technologies and features a dynamic, visually appealing 3D experience built with:

React and Vite for fast, efficient, and modular frontend development.
Three.js and @react-three/fiber for rendering 3D graphics and scenes directly in the browser.
Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions.
EmailJS for seamless contact form integration.
Tailwind CSS for responsive and flexible styling.
@react-three/drei for optimized helpers and tools to improve the 3D experience.
This project leverages component-based architecture to create a scalable and maintainable web application while offering an engaging user experience.

Feel free to explore the code and let me know your thoughts!

Thanks to JavascriptMastery for the tutorial.
